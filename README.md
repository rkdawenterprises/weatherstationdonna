## Weather Station Donna for Android
The Weather Station Donna application fetches and displays weather information from one specific Davis Vantage Vue aka "Weather Station Donna" in Hot Springs Arkansas. If you are reading this you probably should uninstall this application, because it is really just meant for the use of Donna and family members. If you still want to play with it, then please read on.
